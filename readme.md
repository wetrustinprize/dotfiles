The dotfiles are managed by using *GNU Stow*, which is a symlink manager.

To link a configuration you must run `stow` with the program name, like so:

```bash
$ stow lunarvim
```

# Helpful Guides
* [Xmonad installation guide](https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html), better than using the `aur` or `pacman` packages.
* [Github ssh guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), since Github doesn't allow password authentication anymore
