# Prize's Dotfiles

[![Made with Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Visual%20Studio%20Code-informational?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)

Welcome to my dotfiles repository!

Files stored in `dotfiles` should be symlinked to `$HOME`, and files stores in `configs` should be symlinked to `$HOME/.config`.

# Todo

- [ ] Auto install script
  - Automatically symlinks all the files in their specific location
- [ ] Better `xmonad` config
  - Organize each part of the Xmonad config in their own file

# Helpful Guides
* [Xmonad installation guide](https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html), better than using the `aur` or `pacman` packages.
* [Github ssh guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), since Github doesn't allow password authentication anymore
